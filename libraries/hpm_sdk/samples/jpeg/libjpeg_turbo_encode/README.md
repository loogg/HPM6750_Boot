# LIBJPEG_TURBO encode
## Overview
***
**libjpeg_turbo_encode** example project shows how to pass the rgb565 data collected by the camera through libjpeg_turbo library is converted into JPG data and saved in the storage medium.
- the rgb565 data is obtained through **the camera**, the rgb565 data is converted into JPEG data through the code base, and the JPG pictures are stored in **USB** or **SD card**

## Board Setting
***
- Connect the **USB disk** to the development board ``usb0``, or insert the **SD memory card** into the development board ``SD card``
- **Cam camera** connected to development board ``cam``

## Engineering configuration
***
- File [cmakelists.txt](./CmakeLists.txt). If ``set (config_sdfatfs_mode 1)`` is configured, Jpg pictures are stored in **SD card** by default; to configure ``set (config_tinyusbhost_mode 1)``, Jpg pictures are stored in **USB** by default

## Running the example
***
- SD card mode:
When the project runs correctly, the pictures captured by the camera are stored in the SD card and named camera Jpg, and the serial terminal will output the following information:
```
> storage picture data by SD card
> File Name: Camera.jpg
> Libjpeg-turbo encode completed
```

- USB mode:
When the project runs correctly, the pictures captured by the camera are stored in USB and named camera Jpg, and the serial terminal will output the following information:
```
> storage picture data by tinyusb mode
> File Name: Camera.jpg
> Libjpeg-turbo encode completed
```
