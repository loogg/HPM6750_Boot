# Equal symmetric encryption and decryption algorithm AES-CTR
## Overview

**aes_ctr_prng_example** the example project shows the implementation of aes-ctr mode of equal symmetric encryption and decryption algorithm.
- The equal symmetry encryption and decryption algorithm of this project adopts AES encryption algorithm ctr-prng mode to complete the module encryption and decryption test.

## Board Setting

- No special settings

## Running the example

When the project runs correctly, and the serial port terminal will output the following information:
```
> tc_start() - Performing CTR-PRNG tests:
> All CTR PRNG tests succeeded!
> ===================================================================
> PASS - main.
> ===================================================================
> PROJECT EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL
```
