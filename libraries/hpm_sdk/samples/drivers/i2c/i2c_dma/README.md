# i2c_dma
## Overview

The i2c_dma sample project shows that I2C uses DMA to send data.

## Board Setting

- HPM6750EVKMINI：Pin 13 is connected to pin 5 in P1 connector, pin 15 is connected to pin 3 in P1 connector.

## Running the example

- When the I2C DMA data is correctly transmitted, the serial port terminal outputs the following information：

	Master send data OK!

- When the I2C DMA fails to transmit data, the serial port terminal outputs the following information：

	Master send data ERROR!
