# SPI_POLLING_MASTER
## Overview

The spi_polling_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer with polling.
In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on other board as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receives a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.

## Board Setting

Connect SPI master on board to SPI slave on other board


## Running the example

When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
