NXP FreeMASTER Serial Communication (SCI) Driver
================================================================================

FreeMASTER is a PC-based application serving as a real-time monitor, visualization 
tool, and a graphical control panel of embedded applications based on NXP 
microcontroller and microprocessor units. The FreeMASTER Serial Communication 
Driver implements the serial interface between the target application and the host PC. 
The serial interface covers the UART/SCI and CAN communication for all supported devices, 
the EOnCE/JTAG communication for 56F8xxx family of hybrid microcontrollers and the 
USB interface for some platforms.

This driver was tested on all supported platforms in the CodeWarrior Integrated
Development Environment and in other relevant IDEs. Please see the test and example 
applications in the "example" directory. Also read "readme_xxx.txt" in "src_platform" 
directories for more information about platform-specific implementation details.

This Communication Driver is documented in the User Manual located in the "doc\UserGuide" folder.

CHANGELOG
=========

Version 2.0 (August 31th 2016)
----------------------------------
- Added new SCI driver and example applications for Automotive MCU portfolio supporting the 
  SCI/UART, CAN, Non-intrusive BDM and Packet Driven BDM communications.
  The FreeMASTER SCI Driver now supports following Automotive Microcontrollers:
    - MPC56xx family of 32-bit MCUs built on Power Architecture Technology = MPC567xF, MPC560xB/C,
      MPC560xP, MPC560xE, MPC564xA, MPC567xK, MPC560xS, MPC567xR, MPC563xM and MPC564xL platform.
    - MPC57xx family of 32-bit MCUs built on Power Architecture Technology = MPC574xP, MPC577xK,
      MPC577xC, MPC574xR, MPC577xM, MPC574xC and MPC574xG platform.
    - Kinetis EA series of 32-bit ARM Cortex-M MCUs = KEAxx platform.
    - S32 Microcontrollers series of 32-bit ARM Cortex-M MCUs = S32Kxx platform.
- User Guide was updated and also new NXP template was applied.
- New NXP license text provided, effectively no change in license conditions and in terms of use.
- Folders structure at the installation destination was rearranged for better ease of use.
- Simple example script applications demonstrates how to initialize and use ActiveX object 
  functions in the Microsoft Excel and Mathworks Matlab environments were created and stored in
  the "examples\ActiveX_examples" folder.
- Corrected macro function "FMSTR_CLRBIT8" for Kinetis platforms.
- Application Notes AN4752, AN4771 and AN4860 were added as an supporting documents into the "doc\ApplicationNotes" folder.
- One common PC host example application "demo.pmp", applicable for all supported platforms, 
  was created and stored in the "examples\PC_host_demo" folder.
- The default install location was changed to "c:\NXP\".

Version 1.9 (Mar 31th 2015)
----------------------------------
- Support for TSA Active Content. The TSA tables can now contain references to memory-mapped files,
  directories and hyperlinks. The files can be retrieved in FreeMASTER PC Host tool with a special 
  "fmstr:" protocol URL directly within the HTML-encoded pages. This enables the whole project file 
  with GUI, graphics and scripts to be embedded in MCU flash and retrieved automatically by PC Host 
  tool. This feature requires FreeMASTER version 2.0 or higher.
- Support for dynamic TSA entries for variables to be registered in TSA tables during runtime. Use 
  with FMSTR_USE_TSA_DYNAMIC driver option enabled.
- Support for general Q(m,n) or UQ(m,n) fractional format in TSA variable description. Support for
  pointer types added. Fixed TSA support for struct types which are not aliased with a typedef.   
- New "pipes" feature introduced. This feature enables a loss-less communication over multiple data
  streams between target and Host PC. Suitable for console-like control or custom data streaming. 
  This feature requires FreeMASTER version 2.0 or higher.
- New USB-CDC driver from Kinetis SDK supported by default. Older USB stack is still maintained 
  for backward compatibility (use with the FMSTR_USB_LEGACY_STACK option). 
- LIN Transport Layer enabled and tested with S12Z device. Requires FreeMASTER-over-LIN 
  communication plug-in. 
- Transmission debugging option supported for Serial and CAN communication. When FMSTR_DEBUG_TX 
  option is enabled, the target MCU transmits test frames continuously until the first valid
  command frame is received. This simplifies troubleshooting of communication problems.
- This version is also released as version 1.8.2 within ProcessorExpert component in CodeWarrior 10.6.4    

Version 1.8.1  (Jun 28th 2014)
----------------------------------
- Added support for dynamically assigned SCI or CAN base address - for cases where
  compile-time optimization can not be used or is not convenient to use.
- This version of the driver is suitable to be integrated with NXP Kinetis SDK
  version 1.0.
- New license text provided, effectively no change in license conditions and
  in terms of use.

----------------------------------
- Added support for LPUART module of the new Kinetis K22F and KV31 families

- Initial support for Kinetis Design Studio IDE. TWR-K60 project avaliable 
  for KDS, tested with KDS version 0.2. 
- Known issue: USB CDC support not functional when using GCC compiler 
  (the issue affects both KDS and CodeWarrior projects; USB temporarily removed
  from KDS and CodeWarrior-GCC projects).
